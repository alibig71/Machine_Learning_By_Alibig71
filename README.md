# Machine_Learning_By_Alibig71

For such a long time, I wanted to learn about Artifical Intelligence, Machine Leanring and Deep Learning, however, everytime I deciced to start there were lots of obsticle, lots of codes, tutorials, books, that started with lots of theortical explanintion. . As a result, in the middle of 2022, I finally said enough is enough and decided to put my learnings into practice. This repository is the outcome of those efforts. To begin using the models and codes that I implemented, all you need is a *Jupiter notebook* if you're searching for a place to start. If you need any information, feel free to contact me at `Alirezabigdeli71@gmail.com`. I hope my efforts will aid you in your learning process. June 24, 2022
